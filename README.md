You can load this model directly as demonstrated in the notebook to start making predictions as soon as possible
<h3>Input requirments of the model</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b> The input has to be of the shape 64*86*3</b></li>
  <li><b> Input needs to preprocessed using the https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/resnet50/preprocess_input<b></li>
</ul>
