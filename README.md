# Action-recognition-in-Still-Images
In this <b><a href = "https://github.com/shin71/Action-recognition-in-Still-Images/blob/main/Recognizing_actions_in_still_images_distracted_driver_detection.ipynb">notebook</a></b> I show how to recognize actions in still images well using Transfer Learning and Attention Mechanism

You can load this model directly as demonstrated in the notebook to start making predictions as soon as possible
<h3>Input requirments of the model</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b> The input has to be of the shape 64*86*3</b></li>
  <li><b> Input needs to preprocessed using the https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/resnet50/preprocess_input<b></li>
</ul>
